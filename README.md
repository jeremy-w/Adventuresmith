items, monsters, characters, alien worlds, etc). Adventuresmith is free, and ad-free (and will remain so).

### How to use the app
Random tables are a great tool to provide a framework for improvisation.

During game prep or in-game, if you have a choice of:

the second gives you many more hooks to help you create a memorable character to interact with
your players.

Or, if you decide your party encounters a humanoid in the woods...

... would you have come up with an asthmatic half-orc bandit, laying a trap?
