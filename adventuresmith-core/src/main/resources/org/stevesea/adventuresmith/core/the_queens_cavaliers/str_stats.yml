      artistry: | 
                <p>
                A character with a Passion for Artistry is drawn toward things of beauty, 
                be they works of art, music, science, or nature. Such characters are often 
                either artists themselves, or patrons of the arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                <i>Example:</i> <b>Countess Lusienne Castenia</b>, the Lady-Mayor of Gallinea,
                loves nothing more than a grand party to welcome the start of a new
                play, the opening of a new gallery, or the arrival of an artiste from 
                far-away lands. She has a strong Passion for Artistry, even though she
                herself is not artistically talented.
                </p>
      church: | 
              <p>
              A character with a Passion for the Church is devoted to the hierarchy of a 
              religious institution, most commonly the Asrian church under the direction
              of the Matriarch.
              </p>
              <p>
              <i>Example:</i> <b>High Chaplain Farrazin</b>, Guardian of the Faith of 
              Gallinea, is a very devout man, yes. But ultimately his loyalty is less to 
              the teachings of the goddess Essere than to her church. Raised in an Asrian
              orphanage, Farrazin rose through the ranks to become the most powerful
              chaplain in Lutetia -- and there's nothing he won't do for the Church of
              Essere.
              </p>
      country: | 
               <p>
               Passion for one's Country is usually, although not always, the same as 
               a Passion for the ruler of that country. The Passions may conflict if 
               one has Loyalty toward one group or cause who opposes the current government.
               </p>
               <p>
               <i>Example:</i> <b>Baudouin de Longpre</b>, the duke of Rhodope, is one
               of the rare male heads of a province. As the oldest child of his parents,
               who had no daughter to inherent the throne, he became duke upon his
               mother's death. The Rhodope family have supported the Throne for
               generations; they were loyal to the late Queen Elisse III and remain
               steadfast loyalists to her daughter, Queen Mariana II. The crown is
               more than the head that wears it.
               </p>
      faith: | 
             <p>
             As contrasted with Passion for the Church, Passion for one's Faith 
             is less about the religious organization and more about the beliefs.
             It's possible (and quite common) to have both Passions, or also to 
             have just one or the other. Devrans usually have a Passion for 
             Faith but no Passion for the Church, because worship of the Desert 
             Mother isn't based around a complex church hierarchy as with the Asrians.
             </p>
             <p>
             <i>Example:</i> <b>Matriarch Isabene de la Justicia, Bride of the Sun,</b>
             is the head of the Asrian church -- some say she practically <i>is</i>
             the church. However, her strongest commitment is to her deity and 
             (ceremonial) wife, Eserre, goddess of the Sun.
             </p>
      family: | 
              <p>
              Characters with strong familial ties have a Passion for Family. 
              This can include one's extended family and household, or may just be 
              one's immediate family – such as parents or children.
              </p>
              <p>
              <i>Example:</i> <b>Prince Jean-Remy</b> is not merely Queen
              Mariana's favorite uncle, but is also Gallinea's spymaster and head
              of Her Majesty's Secret Service. Haunted by his failure to detect
              and thwart the assassination of his sister Queen Elisse and 
              niece Jehanne, Jean-Remy would do whatever it takes to prevent
              harm to any of his family.
              </p>
      friends: | 
               <p>
               Some people are very faithful to their Friends and would do 
               anything for them – even die for them in some cases. You can decide 
               if this applies to all your character's friends or just a smaller number 
               of them.
               </p>
               <p>
               <i>Example:</i> <b>Gabriana Secouriste</b> is a young member of the
               Queen's Cavaliers. Personable and easy-going, she makes friends easily
               and is slow to lose them.
               </p>
      justice: | 
               <p>
               The cause of Justice is a higher calling to right that which is wrong 
               in the world. The Passion may stem from an innate sense of right and wrong, 
               but more commonly it is a reaction to some act of terrible injustice 
               that has been perpetrated against the character or the ones she holds dear.
               </p>
               <p>
               <i>Example:</i> <b>Andreos Grimani</b>, the High Elector of Ekalia, began
               his public service as a member of the Vigiles Urbani in his home polis of
               Imera. He went on to become a judge, before retiring to enter politics.
               First elected to the Plenum 15 years ago, he became the ranking Elector
               of Imera, then the Senior Elector of Justice, and finally the High Elector 
               -- a position he has held now for three years. Andreos is known for his
               strong drive toward justice as well as his detailed knowledge of the laws
               of Ekalia and neighboring countries.
               </p>
      knowledge: | 
                 <p>
                 Dedication to the pursuit of Knowledge can be expressed through a 
                 desire to learn the truth behind mysteries, to explore the world, 
                 or to learn all that can be learned.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 <i>Example:</i> As a princess, <b>Mariana of Gallinea</b> was much more
                 interested in scientific pursuits and clockwork engineering than she
                 was in courtly rituals and noble intrigues. She was a top student at
                 the Royal Gallinean Academy of Sciences when her mother and older sister
                 were assassinated, forcing her to take up the Crown. In truth, she'd
                 really rather be in a laboratory than in the royal palace.
                 </p>
      love: | 
            <p>
            Romance is the most common expression of a Passion for Love, although 
            there are other types of Love that qualify. Love may be for a single 
            person, or someone's heart may be divided among many loves.
            </p>
            <p>
            <i>Example:</i> <b>Prince-Father Michel Aubene</b>, the widower of 
            late Queen Elisse III and father of current Queen Mariana II, was 
            very much in love with his wife, and she with him. When they first met,
            she was not impressed with the rich southern boy who came to "play
            cavalier" in Lutetia and guard then-Princess Elisse. After she saved
            him during an attack on her life, love soon blossomed. Even the dark
            bonds of death can't quell the love Michel feels for Elisse.
            </p>
      loyalty: | 
               <p>
               The Passion of Loyalty is about dedication to a specific person or group.
               You must specify who is the subject of your character's Loyalty if you 
               choose this Passion. Examples include the Queen (as an individual) or 
               the Queen's Cavaliers (as an organization).
               </p>
               <p>
               <i>Example:</i> <b>Martine Deveaux</b> was once a faithful and loyal
               member of the Queen's Cavaliers, willing to die for the organization
               and those within it. After a disastrous mission with the Cavaliers where
               she was made the scapegoat, she turned on her former companians. Now
               a mercenary assassin, Martine hates the Cavaliers as much as she used
               to love them.
               </p>
      lust: | 
            <p>
            The Passion of Lust is about following one's baser desires, usually expressed 
            through sexual pleasure. Characters who are Passionate about Lust can be flirty, 
            teasing, promiscuous, or even chaste.
            </p>
            <p>
            <i>Example:</i> <b>Genevieve de Longpre</b>, eldest daughter of the Duke of
            Rhodope, is renowned for her string of love affairs -- most of which ended
            poorly. It's said she has at least one girl in every port, and perhaps even
            more! Hopefully they won't all meet at the same time.
            </p>
      pride: | 
             <p>
             A Passion for Pride means a character is highly focused on her own dignity 
             and reputation. Affronts to such Pride are met with strong challenges, 
             as such things are not to be tolerated. 
             </p>
             <p>
             <i>Example:</i> Although only 13 years old, <b>Prince Philippe of Gallinea</b>
             has more pride than an entire village of Scanbrians. The youngest grandchild of
             late Queen Elisse III and nephew of the current Queen, he firmly believes he
             is the most important person in Lutetia, save his aunt Mariana. And sometimes
             even more important, he believes.
             </p>
      wealth: | 
              <p>
              Individuals with a Passion for Wealth are focused on the acquisition of, maintenance 
              of, and spending of sums of money. Some come from poor backgrounds and wish 
              to move beyond their humble beginnings, while others are rich misers who count every penny.
              </p>
              <p>
              <i>Example:</i> <b>Jennevive d'Angelet</b> is the Duchess of Scanbria and head of
              the richest family in the north of Gallinea. She and her husband, Lord Gerhardt, are
              well-known throughout the City of Scanbreille for parsimonious ways, although rumors
              circulate that she is saving up for a major purchase. What that might be, no one is
              sure.
              </p>
